# STIG Compliance Program Implementation

In this project, we simulate the implementation of a comprehensive 
STIG compliance program for a DoD contractor environment.

**Starting State**: Organization has no formal STIG compliance process, 
systems are configured with vendor defaults

**End State**: Formal STIG policy enacted, 90%+ compliance achieved, 
continuous monitoring established, ATO package prepared

## Technologies Used
- Tenable (STIG/SCAP compliance scanning)
- STIG Viewer (finding analysis)
- PowerShell/Bash (automated hardening)
- Azure VMs (test environment)

## Why STIGs Matter
STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides) are the configuration 
standards required for all DoD information systems. Unlike vulnerability 
management which focuses on software flaws, STIG compliance ensures 
systems are configured securely from the ground up.

## Step 1: STIG Compliance Policy Draft Creation

This phase focuses on drafting a comprehensive STIG Compliance Policy as the foundation for organizational security hardening. Unlike vulnerability management which addresses software flaws, STIG compliance ensures systems are configured securely according to DoD standards from initial deployment. The draft policy establishes scope, responsibilities, remediation timelines, and compliance thresholds required for DoD contractor environments and ATO packages.

### Key Objectives
- Establish formal STIG compliance requirements for all organizational systems
- Define roles and responsibilities for STIG implementation and maintenance  
- Set compliance targets (90%+ for CAT I/II findings, 100% for CAT I)
- Create timeline framework for initial hardening and ongoing compliance
- Align with DoD contractor requirements and ATO preparation needs

### Policy Scope & Applicability
- **In Scope**: All Windows/Linux servers, workstations, network devices, databases
- **Standards**: DISA STIG baselines (Windows 10, Server 2019/2022, etc.)
- **Compliance Targets**: 100% CAT I, 95% CAT II, 90% CAT III findings
- **Timeline**: Initial compliance within 90 days, quarterly assessments thereafter

### Key Differences from Vulnerability Management

| **Aspect** | **Vulnerability Management** | **STIG Compliance** |
|------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Software flaws and patches | Secure configuration baselines |
| **Standards** | CVE database, vendor advisories | DISA STIGs, NIST guidelines |
| **Tools** | Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7 | SCAP scanners, STIG Viewer |
| **Timeline** | Reactive (post-disclosure) | Proactive (baseline hardening) |
| **Compliance** | Risk-based prioritization | Mandatory DoD requirements |
| **Documentation** | Scan reports, patch records | ATO packages, compliance evidence |

### Next Steps
1. **Stakeholder Review**: Share draft policy with server team, system administrators, and management
2. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate practical concerns and implementation challenges
3. **Timeline Refinement**: Adjust remediation windows based on operational constraints
4. **Tool Selection**: Identify SCAP scanning tools and STIG automation platforms
5. **Resource Planning**: Determine staffing and budget requirements for compliance program

## Step 2: Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

In this phase, we conduct a stakeholder meeting to introduce the draft STIG Compliance Policy and gather feedback from key teams. Unlike vulnerability management which focuses on reactive patching, STIG compliance requires proactive baseline hardening that can significantly impact system configuration and operations. The meeting addresses implementation concerns, resource requirements, and timeline feasibility to ensure collaborative buy-in before final policy approval.

### Meeting Participants
- **Information Security Team**: Policy owners and compliance experts
- **Server Administration Team**: Primary implementation team for Windows/Linux hardening
- **Network Operations Team**: Responsible for infrastructure device compliance
- **Database Administration Team**: Database STIG implementation specialists
- **Change Advisory Board Representative**: Change management and impact assessment
- **IT Management**: Resource allocation and timeline approval

### Key Discussion Points

#### STIG Compliance vs. Vulnerability Management
- **Baseline Hardening**: Unlike patches, STIG compliance requires fundamental configuration changes
- **System Impact**: Registry modifications, service configurations, and security policies affect functionality
- **Testing Requirements**: More extensive testing needed due to configuration depth
- **Rollback Complexity**: Some STIG changes are difficult to reverse without system rebuild

#### Implementation Challenges Identified
- **Legacy Applications**: Some older applications may break with strict STIG configurations
- **Third-Party Software**: Vendor applications might not support hardened environments
- **Performance Impact**: Certain security controls can affect system performance
- **User Experience**: Hardened configurations may impact end-user functionality
- **Automation Gaps**: Not all STIG controls have automated remediation scripts

#### Timeline Concerns Raised
- **Server Team Feedback**: "72 hours for CAT I findings is aggressive for configuration changes"
- **Database Team Input**: "Some database STIG controls require maintenance windows"
- **Network Team Concern**: "Infrastructure changes need extended testing periods"
- **Management Perspective**: "Need to balance security with operational stability"

### Policy Adjustments Based on Feedback

#### Original Timeline Requirements
- CAT I findings: 72 hours
- CAT II findings: 30 days  
- CAT III findings: 90 days

#### Revised Timeline After Discussion
- **CAT I findings**: 7 days (allowing for proper testing and change control)
- **CAT II findings**: 45 days (accommodating complexity of configuration changes)
- **CAT III findings**: 90 days (maintained original timeline)

#### Additional Accommodations
- **Phased Implementation**: Allow 6-month timeline for full organizational compliance
- **Testing Environment**: Require dedicated test systems for STIG validation
- **Emergency Procedures**: Expedited process for critical security findings
- **Exception Process**: Formal mechanism for technically infeasible requirements
- **Training Budget**: Allocated resources for STIG implementation training

### Stakeholder Commitments

#### Server Administration Team
- Commit to implementing Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 STIGs
- Agree to maintain test environment for validation
- Provide feedback on automated remediation script effectiveness

#### Network Operations Team  
- Accept responsibility for network device STIG compliance
- Coordinate with vendors for enterprise equipment hardening
- Establish network change windows for STIG implementation

#### Database Administration Team
- Implement SQL Server and Oracle database STIGs
- Coordinate with application teams for compatibility testing
- Develop database-specific rollback procedures

#### Change Advisory Board
- Prioritize STIG-related change requests
- Expedite approval process for critical compliance changes
- Establish STIG-specific change categories and procedures

### Resource Requirements Agreed Upon
- **Staffing**: Dedicated 0.5 FTE for STIG compliance coordination
- **Tools**: SCAP scanning software and STIG automation tools
- **Training**: STIG implementation workshops for technical teams
- **Testing**: Additional lab environment for compliance validation
- **Documentation**: Compliance tracking and reporting systems

### Success Metrics Established
- **Compliance Targets**: Maintain 100% CAT I, 95% CAT II, 90% CAT III
- **Implementation Timeline**: 90% baseline compliance within 6 months
- **Operational Impact**: Less than 5% performance degradation from hardening
- **Exception Rate**: Less than 10% of findings require formal exceptions

### Outcome
The collaborative approach resulted in a more realistic implementation timeline while maintaining strong security posture requirements. The revised policy balances operational needs with DoD compliance mandates, ensuring successful program adoption across the organization.
