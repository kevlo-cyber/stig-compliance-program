# STIG Compliance Program Implementation

STIG Compliance Program Implementation Project

In this project, we simulate the implementation of a comprehensive 
STIG compliance program for a DoD contractor environment.

**Starting State**: Organization has no formal STIG compliance process, 
systems are configured with vendor defaults

**End State**: Formal STIG policy enacted, 90%+ compliance achieved, 
continuous monitoring established, ATO package prepared

## Technologies Used
- Tenable (STIG/SCAP compliance scanning)
- STIG Viewer (finding analysis)
- PowerShell/Bash (automated hardening)
- Azure VMs (test environment)

## Why STIGs Matter
STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides) are the configuration 
standards required for all DoD information systems. Unlike vulnerability 
management which focuses on software flaws, STIG compliance ensures 
systems are configured securely from the ground up.
