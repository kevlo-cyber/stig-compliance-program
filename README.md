# STIG Compliance Program Implementation

In this project, we simulate the implementation of a comprehensive 
STIG compliance program for a DoD contractor environment.

**Starting State**: Organization has no formal STIG compliance process, 
systems are configured with vendor defaults

**End State**: Formal STIG policy enacted, 90%+ compliance achieved, 
continuous monitoring established, ATO package prepared

## Technologies Used
- Tenable (STIG/SCAP compliance scanning)
- STIG Viewer (finding analysis)
- PowerShell/Bash (automated hardening)
- Azure VMs (test environment)

## Why STIGs Matter
STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides) are the configuration 
standards required for all DoD information systems. Unlike vulnerability 
management which focuses on software flaws, STIG compliance ensures 
systems are configured securely from the ground up.


## Step 1: STIG Compliance Policy Draft Creation

This phase focuses on drafting a comprehensive STIG Compliance Policy as the foundation for organizational security hardening. Unlike vulnerability management which addresses software flaws, STIG compliance ensures systems are configured securely according to DoD standards from initial deployment. The draft policy establishes scope, responsibilities, remediation timelines, and compliance thresholds required for DoD contractor environments and ATO packages.

### Key Objectives
- Establish formal STIG compliance requirements for all organizational systems
- Define roles and responsibilities for STIG implementation and maintenance  
- Set compliance targets (90%+ for CAT I/II findings, 100% for CAT I)
- Create timeline framework for initial hardening and ongoing compliance
- Align with DoD contractor requirements and ATO preparation needs

### Policy Scope & Applicability
- **In Scope**: All Windows/Linux servers, workstations, network devices, databases
- **Standards**: DISA STIG baselines (Windows 10, Server 2019/2022, etc.)
- **Compliance Targets**: 100% CAT I, 95% CAT II, 90% CAT III findings
- **Timeline**: Initial compliance within 90 days, quarterly assessments thereafter

### Key Differences from Vulnerability Management

| **Aspect** | **Vulnerability Management** | **STIG Compliance** |
|------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Software flaws and patches | Secure configuration baselines |
| **Standards** | CVE database, vendor advisories | DISA STIGs, NIST guidelines |
| **Tools** | Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7 | SCAP scanners, STIG Viewer |
| **Timeline** | Reactive (post-disclosure) | Proactive (baseline hardening) |
| **Compliance** | Risk-based prioritization | Mandatory DoD requirements |
| **Documentation** | Scan reports, patch records | ATO packages, compliance evidence |

### Next Steps
1. **Stakeholder Review**: Share draft policy with server team, system administrators, and management
2. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate practical concerns and implementation challenges
3. **Timeline Refinement**: Adjust remediation windows based on operational constraints
4. **Tool Selection**: Identify SCAP scanning tools and STIG automation platforms
5. **Resource Planning**: Determine staffing and budget requirements for compliance program


## Step 2: Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

In this phase, we conduct a stakeholder meeting to introduce the draft STIG Compliance Policy and gather feedback from key teams. Unlike vulnerability management which focuses on reactive patching, STIG compliance requires proactive baseline hardening that can significantly impact system configuration and operations. The meeting addresses implementation concerns, resource requirements, and timeline feasibility to ensure collaborative buy-in before final policy approval.

### Meeting Participants
- **Jimmy** - Server Team Manager  
- **Josh Madakor** - Cyber/VM Analyst

### Pre-Meeting Context

#### STIG Compliance vs. Vulnerability Management
- **Baseline Hardening**: Unlike patches, STIG compliance requires fundamental configuration changes
- **System Impact**: Registry modifications, service configurations, and security policies affect functionality
- **Testing Requirements**: More extensive testing needed due to configuration depth
- **Rollback Complexity**: Some STIG changes are difficult to reverse without system rebuild

### Meeting Script: STIG Policy Stakeholder Buy-In

---

**Josh:** Good morning Jimmy, thanks for taking the time to review our draft STIG Compliance Policy. As you know, we're moving from ad-hoc hardening to a formal compliance program to meet our DoD contractor requirements.

**Jimmy:** Morning Josh. I've been through the draft, and I have to say, this is quite different from our vulnerability management approach. The timelines you're proposing are... aggressive.

**Josh:** I understand your concern. What specific areas are worrying you?

**Jimmy:** Well, you've got 72 hours for CAT I findings. That might work for patching, but STIG compliance involves registry changes, service configurations, group policy modifications. These aren't simple patches - they can break applications.

**Josh:** That's a valid point. Walk me through what a typical CAT I remediation looks like from your perspective.

**Jimmy:** Take WN10-CC-000005 - disabling camera access from lock screen. Seems simple, right? But we need to test it across different applications, make sure it doesn't break our video conferencing tools, verify it works with our VPN client. Then we need change control approval, implementation window, and rollback plan.

**Josh:** I see. So 72 hours doesn't account for the testing and change management overhead.

**Jimmy:** Exactly. And that's for a relatively simple registry change. Some STIG controls require disabling services, modifying user rights assignments, or changing audit policies. Those can have enterprise-wide impacts.

**Josh:** What timeline would be realistic from an operational standpoint?

**Jimmy:** For CAT I findings, I'd need at least a week. That gives us time for proper testing, change approval, and coordinated implementation. For CAT II, maybe 45 days instead of 30 - some of those configuration changes are complex.

**Josh:** I appreciate the feedback. From a compliance perspective, we need to balance speed with operational stability. The 7-day window for CAT I still maintains urgency while allowing for your process. What about resources - do you have the staff to handle this?

**Jimmy:** That's another challenge. My team knows Windows administration, but STIG implementation is specialized. We'll need training on the specific controls, automation tools, and compliance validation.

**Josh:** We can budget for STIG training workshops and automated remediation tools. What else would help?

**Jimmy:** A dedicated test environment. I don't want to be testing STIG controls in production. Also, some kind of phased rollout - maybe start with non-critical systems, validate the process, then move to production.

**Josh:** Those are reasonable requests. What if we structured it as a 6-month implementation timeline? Month 1-2 for training and lab setup, months 3-4 for non-production testing, months 5-6 for production rollout?

**Jimmy:** That's much more realistic. And we'd need clear exception processes for cases where STIG controls break legacy applications that we can't immediately replace.

**Josh:** Absolutely. We can establish a formal exception process with compensating controls and risk acceptance documentation. The goal is compliance, not breaking the business.

**Jimmy:** Okay, so revised timelines would be 7 days for CAT I, 45 days for CAT II, and we keep 90 days for CAT III?

**Josh:** Correct. And we add the 6-month organizational implementation timeline, dedicated test environment, training budget, and exception process. Does that address your main concerns?

**Jimmy:** Yes, that's much more workable. My team can commit to implementing Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 STIGs under those conditions. We'll also provide feedback on which controls cause issues so you can improve the automation scripts.

**Josh:** Perfect. I'll update the policy with these changes and present the revised version to senior leadership. Thanks for the collaborative approach, Jimmy.

**Jimmy:** No problem. Security is important, but it has to be implementable. This feels like a policy we can actually succeed with.

- CAT II findings: 30 days  
- CAT III findings: 90 days

#### Revised Timeline After Discussion
- **CAT I findings**: 7 days (allowing for proper testing and change control)
- **CAT II findings**: 45 days (accommodating complexity of configuration changes)
- **CAT III findings**: 90 days (maintained original timeline)

### Stakeholder Commitments
- **Server Team**: Implements Windows STIG controls with revised timelines
- **InfoSec Team**: Provides training, tools, and exception process
- **Management**: Approves extended timeline and resource allocation

### Outcome
The collaborative approach resulted in a more realistic implementation timeline while maintaining strong security posture requirements. The revised policy balances operational needs with DoD compliance mandates, ensuring successful program adoption across the organization.
