## Executive Summary

Following the successful implementation of our vulnerability management program, LogN Pacific identified the need to establish formal STIG compliance procedures. This initiative was driven by new contractual requirements with government clients and our commitment to maintaining industry-leading security standards. This project documents our phased approach to implementing STIG compliance across our Windows infrastructure.

## Understanding STIGs

### What are STIGs?
Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are configuration standards developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) for Department of Defense (DoD) information systems. These guides provide:

- **Technical security policies** through prescriptive configuration requirements
- **Standardized security settings** to reduce vulnerabilities
- **Compliance benchmarks** for security assessments and audits

### Why STIG Compliance Matters
For organizations like LogN Pacific, STIG compliance is essential for:
- Meeting contractual obligations with federal agencies
- Establishing a hardened security baseline
- Reducing attack surface through proven configurations
- Demonstrating security maturity to stakeholders

## Business Context

### The Challenge
In Q2 2025, LogN Pacific secured a significant contract with a federal agency requiring STIG compliance for all systems handling sensitive data. Our initial assessment revealed:
- No formal STIG compliance program in place
- Inconsistent security configurations across Windows endpoints
- Manual configuration management leading to drift
- Lack of continuous compliance monitoring

### Strategic Objectives
1. Establish formal STIG compliance governance
2. Achieve measurable security improvements
3. Implement automated compliance mechanisms
4. Create scalable processes for future growth

## Phase 1: Policy Development

### Establishing Governance
The first critical step was developing a comprehensive STIG Compliance Policy to formalize our approach and establish clear accountability. The policy development process involved:

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborated with IT Operations, Security, Legal, and Compliance teams
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluated business impact of STIG implementations
- **Process Design**: Created workflows for assessment, remediation, and exception handling
- **Tool Selection**: Evaluated and selected Tenable.io for automated STIG scanning

### Policy Framework
Our STIG Compliance Policy addresses:
- Compliance scope and system classifications
- Assessment frequencies and remediation timelines
- Automated vs. manual remediation criteria
- Exception management procedures
- Roles and responsibilities
- Continuous improvement processes

### Key Policy Decisions

**1. Phased Implementation Approach**
Rather than attempting to remediate all findings simultaneously, we adopted a risk-based phased approach:
- Phase 1: Policy and process establishment
- Phase 2: Baseline assessment
- Phase 3: Pilot remediation (10 representative STIGs)
- Phase 4: Full rollout based on pilot results

**2. Automation First Strategy**
To ensure consistency and reduce operational overhead, we prioritized automated remediation for:
- Low-risk configuration changes
- Settings with minimal user impact
- Configurations with clear rollback procedures

**3. Exception Management**
Recognizing that some STIGs may conflict with business requirements, we established:
- Formal exception request process
- Required compensating controls
- Quarterly exception reviews
- Executive approval requirements

## Phase 2: Initial Assessment

### Establishing Baseline
With our STIG Compliance Policy approved by executive leadership, LogN Pacific proceeded with a comprehensive baseline assessment of our Windows infrastructure. This initial scan would provide critical insights into our current security posture and help prioritize remediation efforts.

### Assessment Methodology

**Scanning Configuration**
- **Tool**: Tenable.io with DISA Windows 10 STIG benchmark
- **Scope**: 500 Windows 10 workstations across corporate network
- **Date**: June 13, 2025
- **Scan Type**: Authenticated compliance scan with domain administrator credentials

**Pre-Scan Preparation**
1. Configured Tenable.io STIG audit files (DISA Microsoft Windows 10 STIG v3r4)
2. Established scanning service account with appropriate permissions
3. Scheduled scans during maintenance window to minimize impact
4. Notified IT Operations team of scanning activities

### Initial Scan Results

**[Initial STIG Compliance Scan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sRf8dFhMMZOPNkFZ8Uo_VzFnBRn9cMDk/view?usp=sharing)**

**Baseline Compliance Metrics:**
- **Total Checks**: 262
- **Failed**: 152 (58%)
- **Warning**: 16 (6%)
- **Passed**: 94 (36%)

### Finding Analysis

**Severity Distribution of Failed Checks:**
- **CAT I (High Severity)**: 18 findings
- **CAT II (Medium Severity)**: 89 findings
- **CAT III (Low Severity)**: 45 findings

### Key Observations

**1. Critical Security Gaps**
Several high-risk configurations were identified that required immediate attention:
- WDigest authentication enabled (credential theft risk)
- Automatic logon configurations present
- Weak authentication protocols permitted

**2. Common Configuration Drift**
Many failures resulted from inconsistent Group Policy application:
- Local policy overrides
- Systems missing from security OUs
- Manual configuration changes by administrators

**3. Business Impact Considerations**
Initial analysis revealed potential conflicts with business operations:
- Telemetry settings required for helpdesk support
- Convenience features expected by executive users
- Legacy application compatibility concerns

### Risk Prioritization

Working with the Information Security team, we categorized findings by remediation priority:

**Immediate Action Required (Week 1)**
- Critical authentication vulnerabilities
- Remote access security gaps
- Administrative privilege exposures

**Short-term Remediation (Month 1)**
- Network security hardening
- Application control policies
- Audit and logging enhancements

**Planned Remediation (Quarter 1)**
- User experience impacting settings
- Performance-affecting configurations
- Legacy compatibility issues

### Pilot Program Decision

Given the scale of findings and potential business impact, LogN Pacific's security leadership made a strategic decision:

**Implement a Pilot Remediation Program**

Rather than attempting to remediate all 152 failures simultaneously, we would:
1. Select 10 representative STIGs across different risk levels
2. Develop and test automated remediation scripts
3. Measure impact and refine processes
4. Use lessons learned for full-scale rollout

### Selected Pilot STIGs

The following 10 STIGs were chosen for the pilot program based on:
- Risk severity distribution
- Technical complexity variety
